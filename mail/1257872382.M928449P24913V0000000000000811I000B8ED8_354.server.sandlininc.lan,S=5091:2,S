Safe Shopping Tips
Amazon.com works hard to protect our customers. For your safety, when 
ordering items advertised by sellers other than Amazon.com: 

* Always place your orders directly through the Amazon.com shopping cart 
using Amazon Payments. Never send money directly to sellers through wire 
transfers or checks; we do not guarantee such transactions. 

* Beware of e-mails that request direct payments, request payment to 
international locations, or ask for personal information. Amazon.com will 
never e-mail you to pay for Marketplace transactions outside our shopping 
cart, or ask you to confirm personal information such as a credit card 
number or password via e-mail. If a particular e-mail looks suspicious or 
unusual, please contact us directly. 

Reporting suspicious activity at 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/reports/contact-us will help us enhance 
marketplace safety and serve you better in the future.
