sandlinjames,

     You may have noticed that this Community Bulletin is not arriving according to the normal schedule.  Why?  I'm happy to announce that a major code upgrade has taken place.  We wanted to squash as many bugs as possible before sending a mass announcement.  If you haven't visited LQ since the upgrade, you should notice a whole host of usability improvements, new features and performance enhancements.  The upgrade also lays the foundation for some upcoming planned new additions at LQ, so stay tuned.  If there's something you'd like to see implemented at LQ, now is a great time to speak up.  Visit http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=576545 to discuss the recent LQ code upgrade.

     At LinuxQuestions.org, community feedback is absolutely critical to us. On that note, I'm happy to announce the LQ Project Tools, which will allow us to monitor community feedback, bug reports and feature requests in a much better way than we have in the past. If you have a suggestion on a project you'd like to see us undertake, have found a bug or have a feature suggestion, please let us know. We really do listen.  Visit http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/project.php to use the new LQ Project Tools.
